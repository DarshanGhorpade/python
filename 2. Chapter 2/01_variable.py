# Python program for variable

# variables are containers to store value 
# keywords are reserved words in python
# identifiers = class/function/variable name


# How python interpreter will know he has to store number or string
# Here python identifies string as it is written using double quotes "" 
a = "Darshan"
# number is written without using double quotes ""
b = 345
c = 45.32
d = '''Darshan 
is
a 
good 
boy.'''

print(d)


# Printing the variables
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# Printing the types of variables
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))

# Boolean type
d = True
print(d)
print(type(d))

# None denotes nothing
d = None
print(d)
print(type(d))

# Datatype
